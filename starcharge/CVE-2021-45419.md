# Description
The charger firmware is upgraded by providing a zip file, then `/ubi/local/apps/ocpp/ocpp` will service the actual process. The service doesn't have any validation/authentication check against provided archive. Authenticated user can upload the crafted archive to totally compromise the device (there are several ways to upgrade, including via web interface).
